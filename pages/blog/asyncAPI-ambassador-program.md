excerpt: Information about AsyncAPI Ambassador Program.

AsyncAPI and its community have continued growing exponentially during the last months. As a feedback exercise, both the project and its community are getting stronger one with another. The community is the driving force that leads the initiative. Consequently, the bigger it gets, the more consistency and potential the initiative has. It‚Äôs amazing to see the huge amount of people who invest part of their time in disseminating and promoting the initiative through talks, articles, workshops, and program direction... 

To follow that line, the AsyncAPI Ambassador Program has been thought of as one of the latest additions to the initiative to keep the loop going. 

The program is, after all, a reaction to the natural impulse of the community. Thus, in this case, the ambassadors came before the Ambassadors Program itself. This proposal was born based on the recognition of the work of the community members who invest part of their time in bringing AsyncAPI to the community or new potential users. 

AsyncAPI Ambassadors are passionate about open source and AsyncAPI. Committed to making AsyncAPI a place for everyone, thus participating in the leadership and mentoring of the community.

The premises to be followed by anyone who wishes to become an ambassador are:

- Promote user cooperation and disseminate the tools needed for any specific user.

- Engage with the project in some way, whether as a contributor, blogger, speaker, etc.

- Speak at community events or write technical content (e.g., blog posts) that solves community needs.

- Foster community growth and a welcoming environment to spread knowledge about the project.

## Why create an ambassador program?

As we know, each person's way of looking at things is unique. Each person's abilities differ. Following that line, each ambassador can offer a different approach. They bring part of their essence into the content or the program where they are involved and disseminate. This is what brings human value enriching the conception and possibilities of the project.

We are in a time of fast expansion, which means that everything is moving very fast in the community. Last year we not only started the ambassador program, but also the AsyncAPI Mentorship program and participated in the GSoD for the first time. So, the needs of the community are changing and the initiative react being dynamic and open, driving new ideas and proposals.


## How does the program work?

Like any other management issue related to the initiative, the Ambassador Program is approached as a transparent system, where diversity, inclusiveness, and integration are key concepts that are wanted to be materialized in the program.

Thus, the process of recruiting ambassadors is completely open. If a person meets the requirements, they only have to add themselves to this [document](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/blob/master/AMBASSADORS_MEMBERS.json), attaching their personal information along with their contributions. The TSC members will then approve the proposal. 

Subsequently, all ambassador information is displayed in a list on the AsyncAPI website once the PR has been merged. Like this, the process try to be as simple, collaborative, and transparent as possible.

## More about AsyncAPI Ambassador Program

The minimum period of enrollment in the program is one year, with the possibility of renewal on an annual basis. At the end of each period, the number of participants will be determined and verified on a yearly basis. The minimum requirement to be an ambassador is to make four contributions per year in the form of articles, talks, videos, podcasts, presentations, drive initiatives, etc.

Ambassadors acquire some smooth amount of responsibilities on holding this degree. In return, to thank the participants for their work, we try to reward their effort with some benefits, such as special swag and free conference tickets.
